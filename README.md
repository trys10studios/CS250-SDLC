Software Development Life Cycle 

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**

The simple answer is 'user stories', a way to remind the development team that we are in fact working with people and they have needs and wants that need addressing.  and staying in contact makes this possible. 

How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

Asking questions and having an open conversation with the shareholders or customers to figure out their needs or wants in a broad conceptual way helps to solidify what to start on. Keeping an open and continued conversation with the customers helps to maintain their current needs and as the app develops, they may change their minds or may need some changes and updating user stories allows for a more humanized approach. With a contract based or waterfall approach, changes are difficult to make as the overall app idea is developed into strict guidelines and the customer may not know what progress is occurring on their app or if they can understand progress on a large scale, even if such progress were disclosed to them. Scrum's use of user stories is a Kanban like approach (using cards for user's needs) but also adding again, a human element. 

How do I approach developing programs? 

Inherently I have been using the Agile and Scrum-like approach. Using small 'sprints' and a Kanban style card system to keep track of progress. After studying the software development lifecycle, I realize now how effective using a Scrum/Agile approach can work with larger teams and companies. Breaking work for a project into smaller manageable pieces that yield function software at the end of each sprint, allows for a minimal viable product to be developed. Without this approach, there could be features or functionality that are not needed as changes occur for the customer or shareholders. The MVP approach allows the shareholders or customers to see the app in its earliest stages, they may well not need to go as far as they thought they needed as far as features or functionality; that is the biggest benefit to an Agile/Scrum approach. 

What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

 Flexibility is the most crucial factor in agile, understanding that changes will occur and how to navigate those changes effortlessly is paramount in software development. The more projects I develop, the more open-minded I become. Agile is not a start to finish sort of process, it is an evolution of steps until a minimal viable product or ‘deliverable’ product is achieved. This approach allows for faster development as only what is necessary is developed from the ground up. Testing is not an afterthought, it is built right into the development process, as well as keeping customers in the loop. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

In an Agile/Scrum team, a good team member communicates openly and concisely. They are not afraid to share ideas and thoughts, as well as what they are struggling with or if they are in fact if they could do more work to help the team. The idea of “not my job” does not exist with a Scrum team, they are a team member, and everyone works together on a collective goal.
